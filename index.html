                This page is used to inform visitors regarding my
                policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal
                Information if anyone decided to use my Service.

                For a better experience, while using our Service, I

                I want to inform you that whenever you

                I do not collect data and information on your phone.

                I do not knowingly collect personally
                identifiable information from children. I 
                encourage all children to never submit any personally
                identifiable information through 
                the Application and/or Services.
                I encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor 
                their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing 
                their children never to provide personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child 
                has provided personally identifiable information to us through the Application and/or Services, 
                please contact us. You must also be at least 16 years of age to consent to the processing 
                of your personally identifiable information in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent 
                or guardian to do so on your behalf).
